## What Should Happen? 👨🏾‍💻 👩🏾‍💻
 * Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button or refreshes the page, a new random cover is created & displayed
 * When a user clicks the “Make Your Own Cover” button, we should see the form, and the user can create their own book cover
 * When the Make My Book button is clicked, the site should show the new cover that is created
 * When a user clicks the “Save Cover” button, the current cover will be added and stored in the "View Saved Covers" page
 * When a user clicks the “View Saved Covers” button, we should see all the saved covers 
 * From the saved covers view, if a user double clicks a saved cover, it will be deleted

## Want Some Images To Use As Covers? 📚
* When you go to make your own cover the first text form that says **Cover** needs a link/URL for the image! We provided some that are pretty diverse! 👇🏾
