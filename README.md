# RomCom

##Learning Goals
 * Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
 * Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
 * Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

## Set Up
1. ONE teammate: fork this boilerplate repository 
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal
6. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository

## What Should Happen? 
 * Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button or refreshes the page, a new random cover is created & displayed
 * When a user clicks the “Make Your Own Cover” button, we should see the form, and the user can create their own book cover
 * When the Make My Book button is clicked, the site should show the new cover that is created
 * When a user clicks the “Save Cover” button, the current cover will be added and stored in the "View Saved Covers" page
 * When a user clicks the “View Saved Covers” button, we should see all the saved covers 
 * From the saved covers view, if a user double clicks a saved cover, it will be deleted
